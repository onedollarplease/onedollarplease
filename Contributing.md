### Contributing :bow:

I also welcome contributions to this repository as a form of help. If I can perform any activity to increase my chances of getting out of financial stagnation, please suggest it by opening PR into this repository.

This will always be open source so anyone can follow and use this knowledge for the greater good.

I will review every PR, consider it and possibly merge. Also, anyone is free to review other PRs. You can treat this as a public project.
